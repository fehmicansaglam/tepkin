/**
 * The delete command removes documents from a collection. A single delete command can contain multiple delete
 * specifications. The command cannot operate on capped collections.
 *
 * @param collectionName The name of the target collection.
 * @param deletes An array of one or more delete statements to perform in the named collection.
 * @param ordered Optional. If true, then when a delete statement fails, return without performing the remaining delete
 *                statements. If false, then when a delete statement fails, continue with the remaining delete
 *                statements, if any. Defaults to true.
 * @param writeConcern Optional. A document expressing the write concern of the delete command. Omit to use the default
 *                     write concern.
